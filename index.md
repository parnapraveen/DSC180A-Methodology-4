**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic we covered in our domain this quarter was on genetics and how traits can be analyzed through knowledge graph structures. Seeing how protein interactions and common causes of diseases can be mapped out with graphs was fascinating because it's easy to assume that knowledge graphs are only useful for concept in Computer Science. The idea of weighted graphs when analyzing how various traits express themselves in genetics was also an interesting concept when finding the overlap between biomedical concepts and knowledge graphs in Data Science. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
I'm very interested in genetics and how various gene mappings for an individual can make them more or less likely to get certain diseases. This is a possible interaction I would want to explore for the Quarter 2 project. If LLM's can become more and more accurate in tracing these patterns from data, individuals can better prepare for health related concerns, especially as they relate to genetics. 

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
One of the major changes I'd like to pursue for the Quarter 1 Project is to improve the amount of time it takes to complete the query for various prompts to the chat bot. In order to do this, the first step I've completed is to add basic metrics for each prompt. This includes the accuracy and the amount of time the LLM took to find an answer to the prompt. By changing up the different prompts given, the average time for querying the knowledge graph can be mapped out. These statistics can help improve the accuracy and the efficiency of the solutions provided by the Helix Navigator project. 

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I would be interested in using techniques such as gene–disease association modeling, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for integrating biomedical knowledge graphs, and fine-tuning domain-specific LLMs like the Helix Navigator to analyze genomic data. These approaches could help uncover genetic patterns linked to disease susceptibility and improve the effectiveness of health predictions based on knowledge graphs and AI.
